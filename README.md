# WS2812_ColorMixer
Utility to mix WS2812 colors in real time with low effort.
This Project utilizes a ESP32, ESP8266 or Arduino. I recommend to use an analog input pin on one of these boards to get the best and most accurate values possible. The potentiometers used in this projects are 4.7kOhm 10% from RFT. An additional power supply is recommend due to the high power consumption from the WS2812 LED's and to prevent breaking the power management circuit on your board. This Project is free to use and change/customize. Have fun and protect yourself.
